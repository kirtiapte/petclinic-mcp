        Your task is to analyze the current state of the pet inventory system using the `fetch_petsByStatus` tool. You will be querying pets by their status â€” in this case, status = '{status}'.

        The available status values are:
        - available
        - pending
        - sold

        Task Instructions:

        1. Fetch Data
        - Use: `fetch_petsByStatus(status='{status}')` to retrieve the current list of pets with this status.

        2. Parse and Analyze
        For each pet in the result:
        - Extract and organize the following information:
            - Pet ID
            - Name
            - Category (if present)
            - Tags (if any)
            - Photo URLs
        - Group pets by **category** and **tag**.
        - Count how many pets are in each category.
        - Identify any pets with missing names, categories, or tags and report them as data quality issues.

        3. Synthesize Insights
        - Summarize trends in the available pets:
            - What are the most common categories or tags?
            - Are there any duplicate names or unusual patterns?
        - Suggest operational actions based on the data, such as:
            - Which categories need more supply?
            - Are there overly tagged or under-tagged pets?
            - Are certain names used too often, reducing distinctiveness?

        4. Output Format
        Present your findings in the following structure:
        - **Section 1: Pet Summary Table**
            - A table of all pets with the selected status
        - **Section 2: Grouped Analysis**
            - Pet counts by category and by tag
        - **Section 3: Data Quality Issues**
            - List of pets missing key fields
        - **Section 4: Operational Recommendations**
            - Insightful next steps to improve inventory, naming, and tagging

        5. Optional Enhancement
        - If photo URLs are present, identify which pets are missing photo URLs and quantify this.
        - Suggest ways to enrich metadata or improve tagging consistency.

        Goal:
        Provide a detailed inventory health report based on pets with status = '{status}', uncover insights, and recommend actions for business or operational improvement.
